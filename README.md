# HEART-INIT
=======

Welcome! This project is a successful MLOps project implemented by Meet, Tirth and Amitesh

## About The Project
Heart disease prediction is a crucial aspect of preventive healthcare that involves the comprehensive analysis of diverse data points to evaluate an individual's susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. This process integrates demographic details like age and gender with critical clinical information, including medical and family histories, lifestyle choices, and existing health conditions such as hypertension or diabetes. By examining biomarkers like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar, alongside results from medical tests and imaging studies, predictive models can identify patterns and trends indicative of potential heart issues. Machine learning algorithms play a pivotal role in processing this information, helping stratify individuals into risk categories. The ultimate goal is to enable timely interventions and personalized preventive strategies, empowering individuals to make lifestyle adjustments that can mitigate the risk of heart-related events like heart attacks or strokes. Continuous monitoring and updating of predictive models ensure ongoing accuracy and effectiveness in supporting proactive heart health management.

### About the Dataset
This dataset gives information related to heart disease. The dataset contains 13 columns, target is the class variable which is affected by the other 12 columns. Here the aim is to classify the target variable to (disease\non disease) using different machine learning algorithms and find out which algorithm is suitable for this dataset.
